<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I built the backend of this app using Node.js and Express.js, taking advantage of modular routing with express. The app will write notes to a json file. And was provided with the front-end source code to work off.

### Built With

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
